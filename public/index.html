He was picked up as a stray in Corsicana, TX and was never reclaimed... which is a terrible shame, as Turner was clearly a beloved pet once before. He is already neutered, and knows how to sit, shake (with both paws), lay down, and roll over. He is totally house-broken, has wonderful manners, and walks beautifully on a leash. He also has evidence of a prior hip surgery, something that is very expensive! We wish Turner could tell us his story so we could track down the person who put so much time and love into him. </p>

He is a true velcro-dog with a very solid, stable temperament. He has met, interacted, and played with countless other dogs and behaves famously with all of them... with the exception of only one. We believe this difference of opinion stemmed from both of them falling into the same position within the pack and Todd feels there is room for only one supreme shadow/snuggler! </p>

He came into rescue because his previous owner said he wasn't good with chickens – his foster family took him to a farm and Billy could not have cared less about any of the farm animals – including chickens!</p>
